A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/stevesydney/pen/zKQWPK.

 A stopwatch with 4 lap timer slots which uses CSS animation @keyframes to cycle each digit in the display. It uses radio inputs for the main controls, a reset button (triggered by its label), and checkboxes for each lap timer.

The CSS is a combination of the core functionality and cosmetic styling, so it could be simplified quite a bit by visual design.
